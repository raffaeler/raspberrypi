# Raspberry PI
This repository is a collection of tutorials, resources, demos for the small computer called "Raspberry PI": [https://www.raspberrypi.org/](https://www.raspberrypi.org/).
All the material, when mentioning "Raspberry PI" or "PI", refers to that device.

Of course, many tutorial for this device can also be used for many other devices without or with small changes.

Most of the tutorials target setting up a Linux based operating system and the software needed to run applications written for [Net Core 2.0](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/core).
