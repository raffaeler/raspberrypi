# Installing the SDK on the Raspberry PI
The SDK was not available on the Raspberry PI before version 2.1

### Note: this article refers to a preview of the 2.1 version

Prepare the presequisites as specified here: [NetCorePackages](NetCorePackages.md)

Download the sdk at the following URL: [https://dotnetcli.blob.core.windows.net/dotnet/Sdk/master/dotnet-sdk-latest-linux-arm.tar.gz](https://dotnetcli.blob.core.windows.net/dotnet/Sdk/master/dotnet-sdk-latest-linux-arm.tar.gz)

```
curl -OSL https://dotnetcli.blob.core.windows.net/dotnet/Sdk/master/dotnet-sdk-latest-linux-arm.tar.gz
```

If you installed a previous release of the runtime or the sdk, this command will tell you the location, which is probably `/opt/dotnet/` with a symbolic link in `/usr/local/bin`.
```
whereis dotnet
```
If a previous installation is found, you can go into that folder and rename or remove the previous installation. In this case the symbolic link is already created and you can omit the directory and symbolic link creation.

Otherwise you can proceed to create the directory, extract the sdk content there and finally creating the symbolic link:
```
sudo mkdir -p /opt/dotnet
sudo tar zxf dotnet-sdk-latest-linux-arm.tar.gz  -C /opt/dotnet
sudo ln -s /opt/dotnet/dotnet /usr/local/bin
```

Now set the environment variable `DOTNET_ROOT` required to the CLR to know where the dependent libraries are.
```
export DOTNET_ROOT=$(dirname $(realpath $(which dotnet)))
```

If you want to make it permanent, here there are the commands to type:
```
# make sure you are not sudo-ing
cd
nano .bash_profile
# if it doesn't exist, create the file
# add the following lines.
# The LD_LIBRARY_PATH export is needed only if you are compiling and installing 3rd parties libraries such as opencv.
# When not defined, ASPNETCPRE_ENVIRONMENT defaults to 'Production'
# DOTNET_ROOT is needed only if you are installing the sdk

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}:/usr/local/lib/"
export ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Development
export DOTNET_ROOT=$(dirname $(realpath $(which dotnet)))
```

Out of your curiosity:
```
which dotnet  => /usr/local/bin/dotnet
realpath $(which dotnet) ==> /opt/dotnet/dotnet
dirname $(realpath $(which dotnet)) ==> /opt/dotnet

Therefore the previous command is equivalent to:
export DOTNET_ROOT=/opt/dotnet
```


You can now go back to the home folder with `cd` and the dotnet cli should show the version of the sdk you just installed:
```
pi@piraf6:~ $ dotnet --version
2.1.300-preview2-008375
```

## Test the sdk installation
The best way to see if the installation was successful is to create a new project, build and run it. Please note that the nuget restore process could take some time.

```
pi@piraf6:~ $ mkdir test1
pi@piraf6:~ $ cd test1
pi@piraf6:~/test1 $ dotnet new console
The template "Console Application" was created successfully.

## Measuring the time of each step
Let's now repeat the previous test, but measuring the time taken from each step.

```
pi@piraf6:~ $ mkdir test1
pi@piraf6:~ $ cd test1
pi@piraf6:~/test1 $ time dotnet new console --no-restore
The template "Console Application" was created successfully.

  You are working with a preview version of the .NET Core SDK. You can define the SDK version via a global.json file in the current project. More at https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=869452

The build time takes a while, but all the rest is definitely great.
You may want to use a PC with either Windows or Linux to develope the application and deploy the compiled version on the Raspberry PI right after.
To simplify the Continuous Deployment process, take a look to the [https://github.com/raffaeler/deploytool]().

If you are installing a preview version of NetCore, you may need to use the prerelease versions of the packages. Those NuGet packages may be available on the main NuGet repository, in this case you are already ok.
But if you see some package restore failing, you may require to add the pre-release feed which is usually on `dotnet.myget.org`.

The NuGet repository configuration is described here: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/consume-packages/configuring-nuget-behavior
On the Raspberry PI, you may want to create a `nuget.config` file in the `/usr/local/share` folder.
An example of a nuget.config file can be found at https://github.com/dotnet/iot


## Installing NodeJS

Depending on the projects you want to run on the RPi, you may need `NodeJS`. It is required, for example, for Angular Web Applications development.
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_11.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
```

## Installint GCC and other tools
A classic package normally required to compile C++ is the `developer essential`:
```
apt-get install -y build-essential
```
You may need the packages installed in this big package to compile NodeJS native plugin or any other C++ source files.
