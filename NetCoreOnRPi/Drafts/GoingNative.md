# Going Native on the Raspberry PI

**Early Draft**


Before or later, it will come the moment to compile some C++ library for ARM.

In simple cases C# and PInvoke may avoid the need to create a C++ library. But as soon as the amount of PInvokes gets larger, you will discover the need to put all the native code there and create a C# wrapper instead. Also, there are already many good C++ libraries that are fast, efficient and provides all the functionalities you may need.

When using .NET Core, remember that, starting with C# versions 7.1, 7.2 and 7.3, there are new tools and APIs that allows to speed up memory management. I am talking about `Memory<T>`, `Span<T>`, `MemoryMarshal` and related language features allowing to map/cast an arbitrary portion of memory, even if native, to a .NET type.

A part from this, the goal of this document is to provide the best possible solution to compile, in a timely manner, some C++ sources for the Raspbian distribution commonly used on the Raspberry PI.
The provided suggestion is valid for any distribution and is up to you to decide which
